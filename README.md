# Getting Started with Create React App

### Rating App

# Overview

I decided to try to build this app with React framework. It is my first project with this framework. This is more component of more complex website (for example hotel or restaurant website) than standalone app. In fact working with React framework wasn't that hard in compare to CSS. About React code I'm not sure about my solution with disabling SUBMIT button, but it's simple and it works. As i said before the bigger problem was the CSS. The biggest issue with this code is fact that i don't feel confident about controlling it. It was trial and error. At the end it somehow working i cut some useless snippets of code, but i think there is more of it. 

### The Challenge

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
